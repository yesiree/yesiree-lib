A simple mock backend for building prototypes

The idea behind this is to provide a simple and powerful backend that just does what backends do out of the box. Of course, it won't scaleâ€”and that's the trade-off. Currently, it offers the following:
 - Authentication & Authorization using JWTs
 - Persistent storage via RESOURCEful APIs
   - Support for common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
   - Flexible querying
     - Full text search
     - LIKE/contains/Wildcard
     - Regular expressions
     - Less than, greater than, equal to, etc.
     - Boolean comparison
